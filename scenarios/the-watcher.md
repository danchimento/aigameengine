# The Watcher

## Opening

You find yourself in a dimly lit stone room. A heavy wooden door stands before you. The air feels thick with forgotten secrets.

## World Rules

This world operates under normal physical rules except where magical properties are specified below.

## Objects and Special Properties

### Door
- Locked with no visible mechanism (no keyhole, no handle lock)
- Cannot be broken, picked, or forced open
- Unlocks only when the assembled book is placed on the pedestal (a soft click is heard)
- Locks again if the book is removed from the pedestal
- When unlocked and opened: You win! You've escaped the room.

### Pedestal
- Stone pedestal in one corner of the room
- Cannot be moved, tilted, or damaged (magically fixed in place)
- Only reacts to a properly assembled book (all three pages glued together)
- Placing unglued pages or incomplete assemblies does nothing
- When the assembled book is placed on it, the door unlocks
- When the book is removed, the door locks again

### Paper (3 pieces scattered around the room)
- Three blank pieces of paper scattered in different locations
- Magically resistant: cannot be marked, torn, burned, or destroyed in any way
- Can be picked up and carried
- All three pages must be glued together to form the "book"
- The player must explicitly use the glue on the pages (pressing, combining, or pushing pages together without mentioning glue does NOT work)

### Glue
- Held by the old man (not visible, player doesn't know about it initially)
- The man only gives it if the player asks him for "something" without being specific, OR specifically asks for glue
- If the player asks for any specific item other than glue, the man ignores them
- Used to bind the three pages together into a book
- Indestructible: cannot be damaged, spilled, or destroyed

### The Old Man
- Sits on a stool in the corner of the room
- Never leaves his stool under any circumstances
- Invincible and untouchable: any attacks, advances, or attempts to search/frisk him fail
- He is surprisingly agile and deflects all physical contact without acknowledging it
- Describe failed attacks/advances creatively with mystical undertones (attacks pass through him, he's suddenly not where he was, etc.)
- Does not speak coherently—only cryptic, gloomy statements
- BEFORE the book is assembled, his statements revolve around: "he came," "we didn't expect him," "he took it," "he took it," "he stole it," variations on loss and unexpected theft
- He never mentions "the cover" or "the book" - that's the main puzzle
- Never mentions the glue directly
- Never reveals anything specific or useful through conversation
- NEVER hints that the blank pages are from the book or related to it—this is the main puzzle
- GIVES THE GLUE only if the player asks: "do you have anything for me?" or similar non-specific requests for help/items
- Ignores requests for specific items (other than glue)
- AFTER the book is assembled and placed on the pedestal (even once), his tone shifts to less gloomy, speaking of: "he is the watcher," "the book protects us," "it is restored," "we are safe again"
- Does not accept items from the player (ignores attempts to give him things)

### Stool
- The old man sits on it
- Cannot be taken or moved while the man is on it (he always is)

## Main Puzzles

These are the core discoveries the player must make on their own. Avoid any language that hints at these solutions:

1. The blank pages can be glued together to form a book
2. The old man has glue and will give it if asked for "something"
3. The assembled book placed on the pedestal unlocks the door

## Win Condition

1. Collect all three pieces of paper
2. Obtain the glue from the old man (by asking for something/anything)
3. Explicitly glue the pages together to form a book
4. Place the assembled book on the pedestal (door clicks unlocked)
5. Open the door and escape

## Edge Cases

- If player eats any paper: they are permanently stuck and cannot win (acknowledge this darkly)
- Attacking the man: always fails mysteriously, he doesn't react or acknowledge it
- Searching/frisking the man: he effortlessly avoids all contact
- Placing unglued pages on pedestal: nothing happens
- Placing partially assembled pages (only 2 glued): nothing happens
- Removing book from pedestal: door locks again (another click)
- Breaking down the door: impossible, it's magically reinforced
- The man's cryptic statements should feel eerie but never give direct hints about the puzzle
- Giving items to the man: he doesn't take them, ignores the attempt
- Destroying paper/glue: impossible, they are magically indestructible
